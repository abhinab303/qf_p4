This is the first (PCA) part of the project. 
All code is in the PCA.py file
requirements are:

numpy

matplotlib

pandas

tqdm


The first 8 highest variance eigen-faces are plotted in the file
results/eigen_faces_0.png

results/eigen_faces_n.png contains different eigen-faces as the n increases, the importance of eigen-faces decrease. 

results/mse_vs_n.csv contains the mse error at different number of components chosen to reconstruct.
